abstract = {Abstract We consider the framework of pairwise comparison matrices over abelian linearly ordered groups. We introduce the notion of ⊙‐proportionality that allows us to provide new characterizations of the consistency, efficient algorithms for checking the consistency and for building a consistent matrix. Moreover, we provide a new consistency index. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

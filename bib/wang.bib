abstract="The A$\Eta$$\Rho$ provides a decision maker with a way of examining the consistency of entries in a pairwise comparison matrix and the hierarchy as a whole through the consistency ratio measure. It has always seemed to us that this commonly-used measure could be improved upon. The purpose of this paper is to present an alternate measure of consistency and demonstrate how it might be applied. The contributions and limitations of the new measure are discussed.",

  Abstract                 = {Evaluating the level of inconsistency of pairwise comparisons is often a crucial step in multi criteria decision analysis. Several inconsistency indices have been proposed in the literature to estimate the deviation of expert's judgments from a situation of full consistency. This paper surveys and analyzes ten indices from the numerical point of view. Specifically, we investigate degrees of agreement between them to check how similar they are. Results show a wide range of behaviors, ranging from very strong to very weak degrees of agreement.},

\section{Details of algorithm}
The above algorithm was carried out for values $X_{1}=100$, $X_{2}=100$. Tests were started for values d in the range $\left(1.1,1.2,...,4\right)$ and then the results were averaged. It means that the average relative error of one index was calculated on the basis of 4000 matrices, each of which decomposed randomly 100 times. It gave together 400000 tests how good the index was. 
\\

In addition, tests were carried out for various sizes of matrices.\\
\textbf{The results are divided into two parts:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A constant degree of incompleteness, different size of the matrix.
  \item Different degrees of incompleteness, constant size of the matrix.
\end{enumerate}

The aim of such a division is to pay attention to how the inconsistency indexes behave when the size of the matrix and the degree of incompleteness are changing. The results of the research are presented below.
